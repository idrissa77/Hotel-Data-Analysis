This project was inspired by 'AbsentData' and the data was from SQLQuery1 .
The purpose is to answer 3 questions:
 Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
 Should we increase our parking lot size?
 What trends can we see on the data?

 Firt of all, I create SQLQuery1 in SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO 19 then the rest of project is done on PowerBI.
